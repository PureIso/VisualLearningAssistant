Visual Learning Assistant
========
The aim of Visual Learning Assistant (VLA) is to aid learning. Visual Learning Assistant hopes to contribute to the development of the education system through the use of technology, to open the possibility of seeing lots of possible answers to a question, lots of possible ways of interpreting a question and to think laterally. We all process information differently either visually, aurally or physically.

We believe the key to keep students engaged and interested is to have a more dynamic teaching style. We have to let students realise their potential, their creativity and their own style of learning. This begs the question on how we go about making education more interactive and fun in this modern age of information technology. Visual learning Assistant hope to aid learning by the means of visual representation of: knowledge, concept, thought or ideas, to show the relationships between objects and how the symbols are linked with each other. Furthermore, words can also be used to clarify the meaning.

Visual Learning Assistant is an all in one application. It hopes to help solve these problems by representing information spatially and with images in the hope that students are able to focus on the meaning, reorganize and regroup similar ideas or concepts easily, to make better use of their visual memory, make learning interactive and fun and, by allowing user generated contents make learning open to different ways of illustrations.
